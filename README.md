# SparkType - Typing Speed Tester

## Overview

SparkType is a simple typing speed tester built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It helps users measure their typing speed by testing how quickly and accurately they can type a random sentence. The app provides real-time feedback on typing speed (WPM) and accuracy, allowing users to track and improve their typing skills.

## Features

- **Typing Speed Test**: Measures words per minute (WPM) based on accuracy and time.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides live feedback on accuracy as you type.
- **Accuracy Tracker**: Tracks how many words you typed correctly and how many errors were made.
- **Timer**: Starts automatically when the test begins and shows the time taken to complete the test.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices with a simple and clean UI.
